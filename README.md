# NewAugur

New Augur is a fork of the Augur protocol created by the ForeCast Foundation. NewAugur is not affiliated with ForeCast foundation in any way shape or form.

NewAugur

An immutable Augur fork with no market limitations

Augur's recent mainnet releases have shown that their software is reliable. However, prediction markets that could influence activity are being a target for regulation in Augur.

Anarchist who wanted to use Augur can now use, NewAugur, a fork of Augur with mutability removed. Immutability is the primary focus of NewAugur, which will be seeing regular upgrades from the contract fom the Forecast Foundation.

NewAugur REP tokens will be used interchangeably with normal REP tokens on a 1:1 basis.

Therefore 1 REP in the Augur smart contract can be swapped for 1 REP on the equivalent NewAugur fork until the NewAugur contract is released on the 1st of August 2018 1500 GMT.


The Augur Mistake
The developers of Augur decided to go public with their release instead of developing it privately. They are now subject to compromisation through government officials.

NewAugur is building the next immutable prediction platform, come and join us.

Preparing for the upcoming NewAugur competitor
Augur and NewAugur will share only 11,000 coins between the two contracts. Initially, one REP could be swapped for one NEP (New Augur Rep). However, after the 1st of August 2018, this trade will no longer be supported and the price will heavily differentiate. It is expected that anarchists and cryptocurrency users alike will support the DEP fork instead of the REP mutable contract.

Performing the Token Swap now

You have until 1st of August 2018 1500 GMT to swap your REP tokens for DEP.
To perform the swap, send the desired REP amount to 0xB0184f4BE8e96933F77beb6B7470F173701A484B and on the fork date, the total DEP (forked rep) will be sent back.


Teams
Like Bitcoin, there is no official team. Many of the people behind NewAugur have requested to remain anonymous throughout this fork for their personal safety.
